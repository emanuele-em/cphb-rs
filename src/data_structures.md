# Data structures

A data structure is a way to store data in the memory of a computer. It is
important to choose an appropriate data structure for a problem, because each
data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages. The crucial question
is: which operations are efficient in the chosen data structure?

This chapter introduces the most important data structures in the Rust standard library. It is a good idea to use the standard library whenever possible,
because it will save a lot of time.

Later in the book we will learn about more
sophisticated data structures that are not available in the standard library.
