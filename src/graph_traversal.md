# Graph traversal

This chapter discusses two fundamental
graph algorithms:
depth-first search and breadth-first search.
Both algorithms are given a starting
node in the graph,
and they visit all nodes that can be reached
from the starting node.
The difference in the algorithms is the order
in which they visit the nodes.
