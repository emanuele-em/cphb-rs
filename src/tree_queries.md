# Tree queries

This chapter discusses techniques for
processing queries on
subtrees and paths of a rooted tree.
For example, such queries are:

- what is the $k$th ancestor of a node?
- what is the sum of values in the subtree of a node?
- what is the sum of values on a path between two nodes?
- what is the lowest common ancestor of two nodes?
