# Sorting

**Sorting**
is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
Many efficient algorithms
use sorting as a subroutine,
because it is often easier to process
data if the elements are in a sorted order.

For example, the problem _does an array contain
two equal elements?_ is easy to solve using sorting.
If the array contains two equal elements,
they will be next to each other after sorting,
so it is easy to find them.
Also, the problem _what is the most frequent element
in an array?_ can be solved similarly.

There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
also good examples of how to apply
different algorithm design techniques.
The efficient general sorting algorithms
work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
and many algorithms that use sorting
as a subroutine also
have this time complexity.
