# Introduction

Competitive programming combines two topics:

1. the design of algorithms
2. the implementation of algorithms.

The design of algorithms consists of problem solving and mathematical thinking.
Skills for analyzing problems and solving them creatively are needed.
An algorithm for solving a problem has to be both correct and efficient, and the
core of the problem is often about inventing an efficient algorithm.

Theoretical knowledge of algorithms is important to competitive programmers.
Typically, a solution to a problem is a combination of well-known techniques and
new insights. The techniques that appear in competitive programming also form
the basis for the scientific research of algorithms.

The implementation of algorithms requires good programming skills. In
competitive programming, the solutions are graded by testing an implemented
algorithm using a set of test cases. Thus, it is not enough that the idea of the
algorithm is correct, but the implementation also has to be correct.

A good coding style in contests is straightforward and concise. Programs
should be written quickly, because there is not much time available. Unlike in
traditional software engineering, the programs are short (usually at most a few
hundred lines of code), and they do not need to be maintained after the contest.
