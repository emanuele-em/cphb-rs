# Preface

Here a list of some useful resources that tell about Rust in Competitive programming:
This book is from the original version [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) by [Antti Laaksonen](https://github.com/pllk).
In this _Rust Version_ all the theoretical part will follow the Antii Laaksonen's version, except of course for all those parts that need to be adapt to the Rust context.
All code parts are rewritten from scratch.

## Contribution

Please if you think that some parts could be enhanced, don't hesitate to write an [issue](https://github.com/emanuele-em/cphb-rs/issues), each contribution is highly welcome! 

## Why this book?

Popular opinion says that Rust is not good for competitive programming but with a couple of adivice Rust could help you a lot.
As fot the Antii Laaksonen version, this book is not a rust guide and it is supposed that you already know the basics of programming and the basics of Rust.
