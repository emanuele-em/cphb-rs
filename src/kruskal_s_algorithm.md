# Kruskalâ€™s algorithm

In **Kruskal's algorithm**, the initial spanning tree
only contains the nodes of the graph
and does not contain any edges.
Then the algorithm goes through the edges
ordered by their weights, and always adds an edge
to the tree if it does not create a cycle.

The algorithm maintains the components
of the tree.
Initially, each node of the graph
belongs to a separate component.
Always when an edge is added to the tree,
two components are joined.
Finally, all nodes belong to the same component,
and a minimum spanning tree has been found.

## Example

Let us consider how Kruskal's algorithm processes the
following graph:

<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};
\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=above:3] {} (2);
\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=above:5] {} (3);
\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=above:9] {} (4);
\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=below:5] {} (5);
\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- node[font=\small,label=below:2] {} (6);
\path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- node[font=\small,label=below:7] {} (4);
\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=left:6] {} (5);
\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=left:3] {} (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

The first step of the algorithm is to sort the
edges in increasing order of their weights.
The result is the following list:

| edge | weight |
| --- | --- |
| 5--6 | 2 |
| 1--2 | 3 |
| 3--6 | 3 |
| 1--5 | 5 |
| 2--3 | 5 |
| 2--5 | 6 |
| 4--6 | 7 |
| 3--4 | 9 |

After this, the algorithm goes through the list
and adds each edge to the tree if it joins
two separate components.

Initially, each node is in its own component:

<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

The first edge to be added to the tree is
the edge 5--6 that creates a component {5,6}
by joining the components {5} and {6}:


<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};

%\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=above:3] {} (2);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=above:5] {} (3);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=above:9] {} (4);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=below:5] {} (5);
\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- node[font=\small,label=below:2] {} (6);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- node[font=\small,label=below:7] {} (4);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=left:6] {} (5);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=left:3] {} (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

After this, the edges 1--2, 3--6 and 1--5 are added in a similar way:

<script type="text/tikz">

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};

\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=above:3] {} (2);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=above:5] {} (3);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=above:9] {} (4);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=below:5] {} (5);
\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- node[font=\small,label=below:2] {} (6);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- node[font=\small,label=below:7] {} (4);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=left:6] {} (5);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=left:3] {} (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

After those steps, most components have been joined
and there are two components in the tree:
{1,2,3,5,6} and {4}.

<script type="text/tikz">

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};

\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=above:3] {} (2);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=above:5] {} (3);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=above:9] {} (4);
\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- node[font=\small,label=below:5] {} (5);
\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- node[font=\small,label=below:2] {} (6);
\path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- node[font=\small,label=below:7] {} (4);
%\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- node[font=\small,label=left:6] {} (5);
\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- node[font=\small,label=left:3] {} (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

After this, the algorithm will not add any
new edges, because the graph is connected
and there is a path between any two nodes.
The resulting graph is a minimum spanning tree
with weight $2+3+3+5+7=20$.

## Why does this work?

It is a good question why Kruskal's algorithm works.
Why does the greedy strategy guarantee that we
will find a minimum spanning tree?

Let us see what happens if the minimum weight edge of
the graph is _not_ included in the spanning tree.
For example, suppose that a spanning tree
for the previous graph would not contain the
minimum weight edge 5--6.
We do not know the exact structure of such a spanning tree,
but in any case it has to contain some edges.
Assume that the tree would be as follows:

<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};

\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (1) -- (2);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (2) -- (5);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (2) -- (3);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (3) -- (4);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (4) -- (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

However, it is not possible that the above tree
would be a minimum spanning tree for the graph.
The reason for this is that we can remove an edge
from the tree and replace it with the minimum weight edge 5--6.
This produces a spanning tree whose weight is
_smaller_:

<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1.5,2) {1};
\node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {2};
\node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {3};
\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6.5,2) {4};
\node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,1) {5};
\node[draw, circle] (6) at (5,1) {6};

\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (1) -- (2);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (2) -- (5);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (3) -- (4);
\path[draw,thick,-,dashed] (4) -- (6);
\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- node[font=\small,label=below:2] {} (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
</script>

For this reason, it is always optimal
to include the minimum weight edge
in the tree to produce a minimum spanning tree.
Using a similar argument, we can show that it
is also optimal to add the next edge in weight order
to the tree, and so on.
Hence, Kruskal's algorithm works correctly and
always produces a minimum spanning tree.

## Implementation

When implementing Kruskal's algorithm,
it is convenient to use
the edge list representation of the graph.
The first phase of the algorithm sorts the
edges in the list in $O(m \log m)$ time.
After this, the second phase of the algorithm
builds the minimum spanning tree as follows:

```rust, ignore
for ... {
  if !a.equal_to(b) {a.join(b)}
}
```

The loop goes through the edges in the list
and always processes an edge $a$--$b$
where $a$ and $b$ are two nodes.
Two functions are needed:
the function `equal_to` determines
if $a$ and $b$ are in the same component,
and the function `join`
joins the components that contain $a$ and $b$.

The problem is how to efficiently implement
the functions `equal_to` and `join`.
One possibility is to implement the function
`equal_to` as a graph traversal and check if
we can get from node $a$ to node $b$.
However, the time complexity of such a function
would be $O(n+m)$
and the resulting algorithm would be slow,
because the function `equal_to` will be called for each edge in the graph.

We will solve the problem using a union-find structure
that implements both functions in $O(\log n)$ time.
Thus, the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm
will be $O(m \log n)$ after sorting the edge list.
