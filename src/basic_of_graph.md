# Graph algorithms

Many programming problems can be solved by
modeling the problem as a graph problem
and using an appropriate graph algorithm.
A typical example of a graph is a network
of roads and cities in a country.
Sometimes, though, the graph is hidden
in the problem and it may be difficult to detect it.

This part of the book discusses graph algorithms,
especially focusing on topics that
are important in competitive programming.
In this chapter, we go through concepts
related to graphs,
and study different ways to represent graphs in algorithms.
