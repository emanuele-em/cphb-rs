# Dynamic programming

**Dynamic programming**
is a technique that combines the correctness
of complete search and the efficiency
of greedy algorithms.
Dynamic programming can be applied if the
problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
that can be solved independently.

There are two uses for dynamic programming:

- **Finding an optimal solution**:
We want to find a solution that is
as large as possible or as small as possible.
- **Counting the number of solutions**:
We want to calculate the total number of
possible solutions.

We will first see how dynamic programming can
be used to find an optimal solution,
and then we will use the same idea for
counting the solutions.

Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
in every competitive programmer's career.
While the basic idea is simple,
the challenge is how to apply
dynamic programming to different problems.
This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
that are a good starting point.
