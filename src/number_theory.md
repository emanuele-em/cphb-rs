# Number theory

**Number theory** is a branch of mathematics
that studies integers.
Number theory is a fascinating field,
because many questions involving integers
are very difficult to solve even if they
seem simple at first glance.

As an example, consider the following equation:
\\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 33\\]
It is easy to find three real numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$
that satisfy the equation.
For example, we can choose
\\[
\\begin{array}{lcl}
x = 3, \\\\
y = \\sqrt[3]{3}, \\\\
z = \\sqrt[3]{3}.\\\\
\end{array}
\\]
However, it is an open problem in number theory
if there are any three
_integers_ $x$, $y$ and $z$
that would satisfy the equation [6].

In this chapter, we will focus on basic concepts
and algorithms in number theory.
Throughout the chapter, we will assume that all numbers
are integers, if not otherwise stated.
