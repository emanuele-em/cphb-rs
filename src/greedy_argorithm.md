# Greedy algorithms

A **greedy algorithm**
constructs a solution to the problem
by always making a choice that looks
the best at the moment.
A greedy algorithm never takes back
its choices, but directly constructs
the final solution.
For this reason, greedy algorithms
are usually very efficient.

The difficulty in designing greedy algorithms
is to find a greedy strategy
that always produces an optimal solution
to the problem.
The locally optimal choices in a greedy
algorithm should also be globally optimal.
It is often difficult to argue that
a greedy algorithm works.
